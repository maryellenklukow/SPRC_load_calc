all south pool solinst data should be good to go. does not look like I had to do any corrections to that dataset
north pool solinst was frozen 12/11/23 thru 12/16/23 so those depths are not useable
north pool solinst was removed on 4/3/24 due to flooding event
a new solinst was deployed in north pool on 4/17/24 and a correction factor of 2.15 ft was used to correct for the change in elevation between sensor deployment locations
north pool solinst was moved back to original location 6/18/24 so correction factor of 2.15ft is no longer used
north pool solinst was frozen and broke 11/29/23 to 3/10/25 so depths are not useable. new solinst deployed 3/10/25
when north pool solinst was replaced after downloading, it was not placed on pool bottom. an offset of 59.72cm was added to the depth from 5/28/25 to 6/16/25

Water level loggers (Solinst) numbers that are matched to Springcreek North Pool and South Pool

13 is the barologger
8 and 26 are north pool
6 is south pool
I think 18 should probably be labeled 8... assuming it was named incorrectly because I don't think we have a #18 solinst


Review of North Pool files with Morgan's answer:
8 and 26 used at different times; one was replaced with the other due to sensor malfunction
8 goes from 11/29/2023 to 4/23/25
26 goes from 3/10/25 to 6/16/25
