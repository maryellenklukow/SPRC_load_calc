all south pool solinst data should be good to go. does not look like I had to do any corrections to that dataset
north pool solinst was frozen 12/11/23 thru 12/16/23 so those depths are not useable
north pool solinst was removed on 4/3/24 due to flooding event
a new solinst was deployed in north pool on 4/17/24 and a correction factor of 2.15 ft was used to correct for the change in elevation between sensor deployment locations
north pool solinst was moved back to original location 6/18/24 so correction factor of 2.15ft is no longer used
north pool solinst was frozen and broke 11/29/23 to 3/10/25 so depths are not useable. new solinst deployed 3/10/25
when north pool solinst was replaced after downloading, it was not placed on pool bottom. an offset of 59.72cm was added to the depth from 5/28/25 to 6/16/25
