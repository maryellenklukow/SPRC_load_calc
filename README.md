Nutrient budget calculation for Springcreek Confluence wetland

As of 8/11/2025, the budget script is nonfunctional as the Solinst data from the North Pool needs to be reviewed

Before running:
	1. check for any changes to sensor elevations or usable sensor dates
 	2. download the newest Solinst, HOBO, and nutrient concentration files from the Data Portal and replace the old files in the script

Thank you to Dr. Stephen Jacquemin and Morgan Jutte from Wright State University for providing expert feedback as well as the equations to calculate this wetland's water volume.
Thank you to Dr. Raissa Marques Mendonca, Dr. Kenny Anderson, and Olivia Schloegel for their chunks of code.
